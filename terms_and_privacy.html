<title> Terms and Privacy - Jetobri </title>
<h1> Terms and Privacy </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3> Purpose </h3>
<p> The purpose of this document is to outline the innumerable requirements to create the product more effectively. The product, a web-based application for e-commerce, has software requirements that are specified in this document. The SRS covers the scope of the product. The scope also identifies the overall description, functions, constraints, external interfaces, system features, and nonfunctional and other requirements that describe the product’s operation.</p>

<h3> Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions </h3>
<p>This document is specifically intended for developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and the documentation writers. The document contains imperative time-sensitive material on user classes and their characteristics, product functions, operating environment, design and implementation constraints, user documentation, external interfaces, system features, functional requirements, and nonfunctional requirements.</p>

<h3> Product Scope </h3>
<p> This user should be able to access their account by logging in and selecting what products and/or services they would like to view and add to their cart on any device supporting this software. The benefits of this software are that the user is now not only limited to a computer and/or laptop, they could now buy and book their goods and services on mobile devices such as a tablet or cell phone. The objective is to give users a broader variety of choices for the customer and vendors and bring in more customers. Our goals are to eventually allow the software to be used on all main sources or platforms for our customers. </p>

<h2> Overall Description</h2>
<h3> Product Perspective </h3>
<p>This web-based application is to assist all users in finding products and services for a reasonable price in their prospective area(s). For them to view the options, the customer should create an account to search for and contact the vendor(s) of their choice. The subscription package, known a the "Adobansudo Package", starts off with a $10 monthly payment to which includes free 2-day shipping and endless access to vendors. The second option for users without a subscription is called the “Free Trial”, in which the user will also have endless access to vendors available to them, however, only receive standard shipping which will vary between 6-8 days. Users may recieve the free 2-day shipping if they have upgraded their subscription or paid a small fee per order. The concept of this application is to have customers enjoy a variety of different products, goods, and services  produced by local vendors and their various selections, including but not limited to food delivery, grocery delivery, connecting to a hair salon and/or barbershop, and automobile related assistance.All users must be at least 18 years or older to subscribe. The application itself is to aid users of all ages in surveying their options, regardless the reason. </p> 

<h2> Product Functions </h2>

<p> All the following summarize the major functions the product must perform or let the user perform: 
- The user would be able to search for products, goods, vendors, and services
- The result would be based off the users input to the web search
- There are several searching options:
-	Vendor
-	Services
-	Stores
-	Goods or Products
-	When viewing from vendor(s), it would present the available vendors on the application
-	When viewing from service(s), it would present all the services available on the application
-	When viewing from stores, there will be a drop-down menu to choose they type of store or the store name; Whichever the user is looking for
-	Each different category will have only the stores that pertain to that specific category to avoid confusion
-	When viewing from goods/products, it would present the available goods or products available for the user
-	The user would be able to access a favorites tab that will house the user’s favorite products, services, goods, and vendors
-	The user would be able to access a filter option that will give the user access to view certain products or services with certain restrictions
-	The user would have to fill out a mini questionnaire to find the best vendors, products, goods, and services for each user
</p>

<h2>	User Classes and Characteristics </h2>
<p>
There will be three types of users that would be able to interact with the web application: 

-	users who have the "Adobansudo Package" subscription
-	users that have a free trial subscription
-	administrators 

Each would have a different use of the web based application. Both the subscription and free trial users can only use the application to find and contact the vendors for their goods, services, and/or products. This means that the user(s) would be able to search for the products or services, choose a vendor, and contact him or her about pricing, delivery, etc. For the user to contact the vendors, they must make an account through the Web Portal and pay a $10 subscriber fee. However, new customers / users who have free trials, are allowed one free movie and unlimited access to movie trailers. The administrators would interact with the system with the Web Portal, being able to add verified vendors to the database and update information.
</p>
<h3>Operating Environment </h3>
Although this product will be developed on a desktop/laptop application, the software will operate in all environment and hardware platforms. The operating systems to be used for the implementation include but are not limited to all iOS, OS, and android based applications, smart TVs and/or devices, and all PC/Laptop computer environments as well. The web browsers that will be permitted to view this application are Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera. We will accommodate for future search engines and browsers as see fit. The application itself will be updated each week to stay on top of bugs and noticeable fixes.

<h3> Design and Implementation Constraints </h3>
The developers at Jetobri play a major role in the development of this application. Releasing information about the project ahead of the directed time is not permitted and is grounds for expulsion from the project and further projects connected to it. The system will have a terms and conditions portion in which all users (subscribed, free trial users, and company staff) must sign using an e-signature. The e-signature will prove to our system that the customer understands and will abide by the application rules, constructs, and constraints. Failure to comply with such restraints will result in deactivation of the user’s access. The company’s staff must abide by the rules, regulations, protocols, and corporate/regulatory policies that are in place. All the following have been specified further in this document.
<h3> User Documentation </h3>
Although adding a user manual may be helpful, the application will prove to be very easy to work and/or understand. For aiding the user on how the system works:

-	The user will receive a welcome email to greet and thank them for joining the system
-	The user will then receive a separate email to confirm their email address
-	After their email address has been confirmed, the user will then receive one last email, a total of 3
-	The last email will contain specific instructions on how to use the system along with a general direct link to how to use the system via the application’s website
-   The user will receive emails for every purchase and users will not be charged until the order is verified with the vendor(s) </p>

<h2> External Interface Requirements </h2>
